% Note that the a4paper option is mainly intended so that authors in
% countries using A4 can easily print to A4 and see how their papers will
% look in print - the typesetting of the document will not typically be
% affected with changes in paper size (but the bottom and side margins will).
% Use the testflow package mentioned above to verify correct handling of
% both paper sizes by the user's LaTeX system.
%
% Also note that the "draftcls" or "draftclsnofoot", not "draft", option
% should be used if it is desired that the figures are to be displayed in

\documentclass[journal]{IEEEtran}

\usepackage{blindtext}
\usepackage{graphicx}
\usepackage{biblatex}
\graphicspath{ {images/} }
% Some very useful LaTeX packages include:
% (uncomment the ones you want to load)


% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/oberdiek/
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 4.0 (2003-05-27) and later if using hyperref.sty. cite.sty does
% not currently provide for hyperlinked citations.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/cite/
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  % \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  % \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/graphics/
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found as epslatex.ps or
% epslatex.pdf at: http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage[cmex10]{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics. If using
% it, be sure to load this package with the cmex10 option to ensure that
% only type 1 fonts will utilized at all point sizes. Without this option,
% it is possible that some math symbols, particularly those within
% footnotes, will be rendered in bitmap form which will result in a
% document that can not be IEEE Xplore compliant!
%
% Also, note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/amslatex/math/





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithms/
% There is also a support site at:
% http://algorithms.berlios.de/index.html
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithmicx/




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/tools/


%\usepackage{mdwmath}
%\usepackage{mdwtab}
% Also highly recommended is Mark Wooding's extremely powerful MDW tools,
% especially mdwmath.sty and mdwtab.sty which are used to format equations
% and tables, respectively. The MDWtools set is already installed on most
% LaTeX systems. The lastest version and documentation is available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/mdwtools/


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.


%\usepackage{eqparbox}
% Also of notable interest is Scott Pakin's eqparbox package for creating
% (automatically sized) equal width boxes - aka "natural width parboxes".
% Available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/eqparbox/





% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\usepackage[tight,footnotesize]{subfigure}
% subfigure.sty was written by Steven Douglas Cochran. This package makes it
% easy to put subfigures in your figures. e.g., "Figure 1a and 1b". For IEEE
% work, it is a good idea to load it with the tight package option to reduce
% the amount of white space around the subfigures. subfigure.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/obsolete/macros/latex/contrib/subfigure/
% subfigure.sty has been superceeded by subfig.sty.

\boldmath
Modern interactive museums offer visitors a dynamic learning environment, promoting exploration and encourage the excitement of discovery as visitors learn new concepts, as they are free to interact with the exhibits. In this paper we propose an architecture for an interactive learning environment (ILE) using a collection of commodity devices: a set of displays where different content is presented, a set of mobile devices for each visitor to interact and a Kinect sensor. The engagement affective state is predicted using various classifiers and a database of readings from the Kinect sensor. The architecture also addresses the problem of content distribution among devices.  A case study of an interactive exhibit held in classrooms. The participants were students of Technologic Institute of Tijuana. Experimental results show that the proposed approach can predict the engagement affective state.

\section{Introduction}


A museum is a public or private institution at the service of the society and its development. These exhibit sets of objects and information that reflect some aspect of human existence or its environment. The museum dates back to the Greco-Roman period, since museums have undergone many changes in terms of how to present the information thanks to technological advances that have emerged, this change has been most noticeable in the last century to date.

In addition to technology there are new techniques and methods to improve the user experience in these museums as interaction, user preferences, virtual and mixed realities among others. Since its beginnings the main objective of museums has been to preserve the cultural heritage, but also make information shown attractive to public in general, this part is a big challenge because each person thinks and assimilates information differently and one of the ways to solve this problem is by making the content adaptive.
Interactive museums have been multiplying in recent year, many of which the idea of attracting the public using new technologies, currently there are studies that seek ways to solve the problem of making more attractive exhibits for the museum visitors as it does (aoki 2002; aoki 2002) where their electronic guidebook allows users to share auditory information (They hear each other) using a technologically mediated audio eavesdropping mechanism.

Reilly 2007 uses another approach oriented towards audio-visual experience where literary information shows through high large screens where the user can interact with the museum with touch screens.Others besides dealing with how to present information have involved more with the user from using their personal information to use methods to predict the state of mind. In affective computing there are several affective states but one that goes hand in hand with learning which is the engagement, like all state of mind is difficult to identify.Allen tell us how to design exhibits and how not make it anti-engagement like using lots of content in multiple displays.   
In this paper we propose the architecture of an interactive environment which consists of the distribution of multimedia content in an exhibit where the content is displayed in sets of learning objects which we call environmental learning object, a simple sequenced implementation which will make the task of a museum guide establishing the order of the learning activities. And finally we use the second-generation Kinect sensor to capture video of the user and predict an emotion based on this catalog the exhibition state as something that engages the user or something that does not engage the user. To test this architecture we conducted an experiment in an interactive museum where we generate a learning activity, at the end of the activity we surveyed the user to obtain information from the user experience and affective state and compare it against the pronostic of the affective state and identify the least interesting activities.


\section {Background}

\subsection {Interactive museums}
Museums at the present are exploring new digital and mobile technologies to enhance the visitor experience. Initiatives go beyond technology within exhibits, but also include more widespread use of technology to create interactive experiences for visitors throughout a museum and remote experiences for those who can not get there.
\subsection {Intelligent Learning Environments}
Intelligent Learning Environments (ILE) are based in learning environments where students and teachers can create knowledge. In other words, the environment represents a cognitive space for a learning community. The ILE seeks to provide adaptive navigation and adaptive sequencing as is commented on  \cite{rondon89}, [10] and [15].The adaptive navigation presents the content of a course in optimized order, where the optimization criteria takes into consideration the learner's backgrounds and performance, whereas adaptive sequencing is defined as the process for selection of learning objects from a digital repository and sequencing them in a way which is appropriated for the targeted learning community or individuals. 
\subsection {Affective Computing}
Affective computing is the human-computer interaction in which a device has the ability to detect and respond to the emotions of the user and other stimulus properly. A computing device with this capability could gather the signals to the user emotion from a variety of sources. Facial expressions, posture, gestures, speech, strength and pace of keystrokes and temperature changes of hand on a mouse all can mean changes in the emotional state of the user, and these can be detected and interpreted by a computer. A camera is used to capture images of the user and the data is processed algorithms to produce meaningful information. Voice recognition and gesture recognition are some of the other technologies being explored for affective computing applications.
\subsection {Learning Objects}


\subsection {Kinect 2.0}

\section {Method}

Describe the sample/participants
Este estudio se divide en 2, en la primera parte consiste con visitantes del museo el trompo de tijuana donde participaron 21 usuarios divididos en 2 grupos, el primero cuenta con 10 usuarios de entre 6 y 11 años 50\% hombres y 50\% mujeres y el segundo grupo de consistia de 11 usuarios de 11 años en adelante 66\% hombres 44\% mujeres. En la segunda parte del estudio se utilizaron usuarios 41 usuarios del instituto tecnologico de tijuana con edades entre los 18 y 50 años.   
Describe the materials
Para este estudio se utilizaron diversos dispositivos una computadora que hacia de servidor, 2 laptops, 1 tablet de 7 pulgadas, audifonos, 3 proyectores 2 monitores, camaras, sensores (Kinect 2.0) etc.    
explain the investigation design
En la primer parte del estudio se utilizo la siguiente configuracion, 3 proyectores donde se mostraban imagenes 
explain how you measure a what calculation you made  
As a case study we conduct 2 experiments the first to test the acceptance of different types of users in the environment, The first experiment took place in the interactive museum "El Trompo" of Tijuana where the user was introduced in an environment which had to perform a sequence of activities and at the end of the activity was a survey below is explains in detail each of the parts of the experiment.
The technological part of the experiment (Devices) consisted of 3 projectors, 2 computers, one tablet and headphones como se observa en las figuras 1 y 2.

\end{figure}
Users who participated in the experiment consisted of a set of 21 users between the ages of 6 and 48 years. divided into 2 sets the first 11 users with 11 or more years and the second set with users under 11 years. the reason to separate them at this age because the environment was showed different information depending on the age of users.

\end{figure}
The theme chosen for use in the activity was determined for the following reasons, was an early date to a holiday about children called "El dia del niño" and we think of something that will raise awareness of children that affects the world. So we prepare the "Water" as its main theme where information was displayed as the care that must be taken with water, in that it benefits, health, pollution, energy producing, etc.

The second experiment was to explore the impact of the exhibit on the users, a convenience sample of 40 students and teachers of Tecnologico de Tijuana aged between 18 and 40 years where the most frequent age was 19 years was undertaken. Participating students completed the activity shown on the exhibit. Which consisted of two videos with the themes of video games and movies, users used the display for a period of 4 minutes 20 users on the first day and 2 on the second day. Each user was shot with a film camera and a special camera that takes additional attributes like engagement , if not watching the display and positions of the eyes or mouth .

% An example of a floating figure using the graphicx package.
% Note that \label must occur AFTER (or within) \caption.
% For figures, \caption should occur after the \includegraphics.
% Note that IEEEtran v1.7 and later has special internal code that
% is designed to preserve the operation of \label within \caption
% even when the captionsoff option is in effect. However, because
% of issues like this, it may be the safest practice to put all your
% \label just after \caption rather than within \caption{}.
%
% Reminder: the "draftcls" or "draftclsnofoot", not "draft", class
% option should be used if it is desired that the figures are to be
% displayed while in draft mode.

% Note that IEEE typically puts floats only at the top, even when this
% results in a large percentage of a column being occupied by floats.


% An example of a double column floating figure using two subfigures.
% (The subfig.sty package must be loaded for this to work.)
% The subfigure \label commands are set within each subfloat command, the
% \label for the overall figure must come after \caption.
% \hfil must be used as a separator to get equal spacing.
% The subfigure.sty package works much the same way, except \subfigure is
% used instead of \subfloat.

%\end{figure*}
%
% Note that often IEEE papers with subfigures do not employ subfigure
% captions (using the optional argument to \subfloat), but instead will
% reference/describe all of them (a), (b), etc., within the main caption.


% An example of a floating table. Note that, for IEEE style tables, the 
% \caption command should come BEFORE the table. Table text will default to
% \footnotesize as IEEE normally uses this smaller font for tables.
% The \label must come after \caption as always.
%
%\begin{table}[!t]
%% increase table row spacing, adjust to taste
%\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.3}
% if using array.sty, it might be a good idea to tweak the value of
% \extrarowheight as needed to properly center the text within the cells
%\caption{An Example of a Table}
%\label{table_example}
%\centering
%% Some packages, such as MDW tools, offer better commands for making tables
%% than the plain LaTeX2e tabular which is used here.
%\begin{tabular}{|c||c|}
%\hline

%\hline
%Three & Four\\
%\hline
%\end{tabular}
%\end{table}


% Note that IEEE does not put floats in the very first column - or typically
% anywhere on the first page for that matter. Also, in-text middle ("here")
% positioning is not used. Most IEEE journals use top floats exclusively.
% Note that, LaTeX2e, unlike IEEE journals, places footnotes above bottom
% floats. This can be corrected via the \fnbelowfloat command of the
% stfloats package.
